To Start:
1. download the files
2. once you've put them into where you want to open the program you use such as vs code
3. Once in that program  make sure you're in the correct directory, open a terminal and type "npm i" to install all npm packages necessary
4. Then type nodemon index.js
5. If all has gone well you should be able to go into your browser and type localhost:3000 into the URL


A few notes:
I left the CSS as a basic bootstrap so I could focus on the functionality of the site.
