To Start:
1. download the files
2. once you've put them into where you want open the program you use such as vs code
3. Once in that program  make sure you're in the correct directory and open a terminal and type "npm i" to install all npm packages necessary
4. Then type nodemon index.js
5. If I'm not forgetting anything you should be able to go into your browser and type localhost:3000 into the url


A few notes:
I left the css as basic bootstrap so I could focus on the functionality of the site.
I also left in the code I had for a second api integration, but commented out it's section in the ejs file so it won't appear, as I wasn't able to confirm if my changes were fixed since
I hit the rate limit for that api.
